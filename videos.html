        <h2>Episode 1: Composition</h2>
        <h4>Topics Discussed:</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Keeping Focus</li>
          <li>Proximity</li>
          <li>White Space</li>
        </ul>
        <p>For my first video, I wanted to discuss a core fundamental of design that I feel is one of the most, if not the most, important principles I learned while going through traditional schooling. Composition as a concept was constantly being reintroduced with each class I would complete and the overall discussion was always similar whether it was a class based around user interface design or photography. This repetition drilled the idea of good composition into my brain and it is a quality of my work that I am consistently trying to improve. So for this video, I decided to go over the importance of keeping focus on a subject or multiple subjects as a way to guide the viewers eyes accordingly. Then I went into how utilizing proximity to group objects that relate to each other reduces confusion within the design such as how a well designed business card groups all contact info together. Finally, I talked about the importance of white space and how it can be helpful in avoiding clutter and keeps the viewer from misunderstanding the subject as well.</p>

        <h2>Episode 2: Color</h2>
        <h4>Topics Discussed:</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Color Wheel</li>
          <li>Primary vs. Secondary</li>
          <li>HSV</li>
        </ul>
        <p>After composition, I thought it was necessary to consider the relevance of color in design. Even though art does not inherently need to have color incorporated into it, it is very helpful to understand how the color wheel functions and how characteristics like Value, which can be found in shades of black and white, can greatly effect any design. I started with giving a brief definition of primary vs. secondary colors and how each of them plays their role on the color wheel and how they affect the viewers perception. After that, I discussed the three main attributes that will be associated with any color which would be Hue, Saturation, and Value. Hue is the color itself, Saturation is the intensity of said color, and Value, which is the amount of lightness or darkness that a color may have. These traits can play a big roll in how dominant the colors are in your design.</p>

        <h2>Episode 3: Type</h2>
        <h4>Topics Discussed:</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Typeface vs. Font</li>
          <li>Classifications</li>
          <li>Chararacteristics</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Typography is one of the more recent principles that I have grown a major appreciation for due to the fact that it is one of the most difficult concepts to get right and even harder to master. First, I went over the difference between a typeface and a font because this seems to be one of the most misunderstood areas of using text because a typeface refers to the entire family collection while a font is the a singular piece of type with a specific size, width, and style. Next, I felt it was beneficial to go over the five main classifications of type which would be serif, sans-serif, script, monospaced, and display. Each of those come with their own emotions and moods attached to them so make sure you are matching the feeling of your art with the type that is displayed with it. Lastly, I talked about the three main properties that can be applied to any piece of text which would be Leading, Kerning, and Tracking and how each of them plays their role in outlining any type.</p>

        <h2>Episode 4: Failure</h2>
        <h4>Topics Discussed:</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Journey</li>
          <li>Mistakes</li>
          <li>Improvements</li>
        </ul>
        <p>For my final video, I wanted to talk about something a little less technical than my previous videos because as I have gone through many years of graphic design schooling, I have learned that there is often a major stigma around making mistakes or failing. This creates a fear of creating something that a professor or colleague might critique harshly and causes designers to create less inspired art which is never a positive thing. So I wanted to go over some of the mistakes I made during my capstone and explain why each of those mistakes pushed me to learn something new and create better content the next time. I discussed how I failed in areas of audio and editing but improved in my lighting and confidence overall. So do not worry about making plenty of mistakes when designing because some of the best ideas come from previous failures.</p>

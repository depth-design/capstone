      <h2>Here is a breakdown of my creative process when creating my capstone.</h2>
    </div>
    <div class="question-process">
      <p>I chose the idea of informal vs. formal learning because I have always struggled with keeping my focus in traditional teaching settings such as high school or university. This could be for a multitude of reasons but I still decided to persue higher education in the graphic design field so I needed to find ways to assist myself in learning material that I was not as easily grasping.<br><br>Often times this led to me searching for video content on websites such as YouTube to re-teach me the material. But I almost always ran into similar problems because the educational graphic design content online is usually structured in a similar manner to classroom settings which doesn’t really help with my retention.</p>
      <h3>Why is <br>this my <br>project?</h3>
      <p>So in an effort to make graphic design content that is easier to follow and focuses on the younger generation of designers, I have created Depth. Depth is a multi-part video series that goes over various topics and principles of graphic design that I have learned over many years of formal and informal education and would like to share with the public.<br><br>These videos are never longer than a minute as this is the most common form of media consumption currently by younger audiences with the popularity of apps like TikTok. These are the type of videos I wish I had available to me when I was going through my beginning years of design schooling so I hope that my information is found to be helpful.</p>

    <div class="video-process">
      <p>I decided to use the video format for my capstone for multiple reasons. Initially, I made this choice because I wanted to combine several of my passions into my final project in college. These passions would be creating content with my camera, either though photography or videography as well as graphic design naturally.<br><br>With this idea in mind, I started looking into what is currently being taught through this medium on various streaming websites. I found a good amount of fairly formal video based websites such as LinkedIn Learning and SkillShare which were often teaching about using the programs that designers like Photoshop or topics related to logo design, etc. While these websites can be very helpful, I always struggled to keep attention when watching longer form video taught in this manner so I decided to utilize Youtube Shorts, which is a newer form of video streaming for the already massively successful website.<br><br>YouTube Shorts allowed me to produce short form content that could connect with a younger generation of designers interested in the art that may also struggle learning from more formal videos. </p>
      <h3>Why did I <br>choose to <br>make videos?</h3>

    <div class="logo-process">
      <p>I randomly came up with the name “Depth” while thinking about the different topics I might go over in my video series. Since my videos are not very long, I didn’t want to give the impression that I am going to teach all of these complex topics but rather, I am going to introduce several ideas I think are relevant to design and based upon which one the audience enjoys, they can choose to “dive deeper” if they desire. And while the idea of depth didn’t get its own episode, I think the overall concept was conveyed throughout each video.<br><br>Once I had my name chosen, I needed to figure out how to display the concept so I started brainstorming different things that contain depth such as the ocean which is how I came to my chosen color palette. Suddenly, the idea of a deconstructed cube that feels flat but also shows dimension came to me and that was the basis of my logo design. Through several iterations and reworks, the logo you see to the right is my final product.</p>
      <h3>How did <br>I make <br>my logo?</h3>

    <div class="website-process">
      <p>After creating the videos for this project, I knew that a site to host them apart from the YouTube channel would be beneficial for people who are interested in learning more about my capstone. Rather than try to put my specific design information inside the YouTube description box, I felt it would be easier to understand the scope of my goals with a whole website that discussed each part of the project and gave some deeper insight that the channel could not supply as easily.<br><br>This also gave me a little more creative freedom because I was not limited to the one minute time frame that restricted some of the videos content. This website was hand-coded by myself because I felt that I needed to add some more graphic design elements into my capstone and this seemed like one of the best ways to achieve that.</p>
      <h3>How did I <br>make the <br>website?</h3>

    <div class="notebook-process">
      <p>I have purchased a sketchbook every year for the past 5 years at least because my professors have emphasized the importance of them in every area of graphic design. And I have definitely understood the value of them but I have always found myself writing down words or phrases when brainstorming along with small doodles of my ideas.<br><br>So for me, a small notebook has become more and more appealing as I have grown as a designer because they are not as wide as the sketchbooks I’ve used in the past and they are easier to carry around. I hope this notebook encourages people to start carrying around something to jot down ideas or doodle pictures because I feel those things are incredibly important in keeping your creativity sharp.</p>

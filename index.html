          <h2>Who am I?</h2>
          <p>Hey! My name is Ethan and I am an aspiring graphic designer
            and photographer with a love for anything related to content
            creation. I actually didn’t draw much as a child so I always
            felt like my artistic skills were lacking in that realm but
            once I discovered graphic design and the idea that anything
            you think of can be created with the computer on my desk,
            my whole mindset changed and I fell in love with learning all
            of the software that is related to my work.
            <br><br>
            I have always had a fondness for brand design but in the recent years, I have
            started to really enjoy animation as well as UI/UX design.
            I really hope my dedication to the craft shows through in
            my designs and I will continue learning as much as I can to
            ensure I provide the best art possible.</p>

          <h2>What is depth?</h2>
          <p>Depth was created because I found myself constantly searching
            for new content related to graphic design on websites such as
            YouTube but would have a less than enjoyable experience when some
            of the same topics were being taught in a classroom setting.
            I realized that formal teaching is not my preferred method of
            learning about a new subject.
            <br><br>
            This prompted me to research the
            true value of informal versus formal learning and I discovered
            that it is very common for people, especially younger generations,
            to have a more difficult time being taught formally and I wanted
            to do my part to help another person who may learn similarly.
            This Youtube Shorts video series serves to provide design
            fundamentals to newer graphic artists who have a much easier
            time learning informally.</p>
